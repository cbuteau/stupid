A language that is stupid

## Concept

I had this idea of building a language that is incredible stupid.
that the hello world program is...

```cmd
hello('world');
```

built on ES6 javascript.


## Ideas

functions declared with func
variables declared with let
loops declared with loop


soon after declaring functions and calling them figure out recursion.



```cmd
loop iterate items
end
```

```cmd
loop index
end
```
